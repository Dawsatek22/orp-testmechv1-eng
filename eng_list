***Warnings and summary:
The tutorial instruction is explained in the eng_list.
The list of tools and materials  is put in here below.
This is a project that supposed to be improved overtime so it is not perfect
but fuctional,This project works with voltages from 3.3V to 9V
so it is better to be careful with it.It is recommended to check if you can afford 
the parts and material that is neede,In the tutorial the motor shield is soldered before hand.
The servos need to calibrated to 90 degrees angles before attaching together with the robot.
There were changes made mid recording so material may looks diffirent overtime
If something is wrong or missing can you please
comment about it so i can fix the issue
